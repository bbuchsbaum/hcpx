\title{Z-score normalize time series (per-run aware)}
\usage{
zscore(vec, run_boundaries = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{vec}{NeuroVec to normalize}

\item{run_boundaries}{Optional integer vector of run lengths for split
normalization. If provided, each run is normalized independently before
being recombined. This prevents run-to-run baseline differences from
affecting the normalization.}
}
\value{
Normalized NeuroVec with same dimensions as input.
}
\description{
Normalizes a NeuroVec time series to zero mean and unit variance.
Supports per-run normalization to handle multi-run concatenated data.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Simple normalization
vec_z <- zscore(run_data$dtseries)

# Per-run normalization for concatenated data (2 runs of 405 TRs each)
vec_z <- zscore(combined_data$dtseries, run_boundaries = c(405, 405))
}
